                <p>First of all, happy advent? Yeah, I have no idea what to say there because it's not really christmas (I'm Jewish if you didn't know) but also a lil' birdy told me you were pretty into advent calendars (and I definitely have lots of time to spend making this, it's not finals or anything) so here goes. Disclaimer: It's definitely not as good as a chocolate or wine calendar, I know, but bear with me.</p>

                <p>In a few days it's going to be 4 months (yeah, wtf), and I know we've been apart for a lot of that time. But we've also had a lot of amazing experiences and I thought it would be nice to highlight some of them. Every day I'll try and post about a date, trip, or experience that we've done, or maybe just some music that we're both into. So here goes, day 1.</p>
                <p>Speaking of day 1, let's throw it back to a message that will never get old. Your first rejection! How exciting...</p>

              <p>So I figured I'd do a lil expose on you and work. That is, afterall, one of the first things I knew about you: you work a lot, and are good at it. Throwback to you studying orgo all the time and not wanting to get Gelato.</p>
              <p>Your ability to grind out so much work on such a variety of subjects is something I've always admired about you.</p>
              <p>That you can go from 20 hour orgo days in the library, to cranking out 2000+ words a day of philosophy on a class you claim to not even understand, truly baffles me.</p>
              <p>Soooooo, I decided to compile some of my favorite moments of you/us doing work over the past few months.</p>

              <p><b>​Edinburgh 12/1 - 124</b></p>
              <p>​<b>​12/1 Arrival (this only gets its own section cus you’re a butt 💁)</b>​</p>
              <p>​Upon my arrival late 12/1 ✈️ I was savagely tricked into thinking I’d have to ride all the way to your room alone 😒😤😖😢 and for this you received this sassy message</p>

              <img width="50%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day4/sass.jpg">

              <p>​But I won’t lie, made me very happy to see your cute face standing right there when I came out 😊 and you were wearing those nice leggings 😏</p>
              <p>And to make it even better you even got me a chicken 🐓 siracha wrap from Hula 😍</p>
              <p>We got back to your room, I dropped my stuff and we... caught up... until about 5 in the morning when we took a couple hour nap 😴 and then got back to catching up 😉</p>
              <p>Oh, I also gave you your surprise, the best advent calendar 📆 everrr!!!!!</p>

              <p><b>​Saturday 12/2</b></p>
              <p>​Finally we decide its time to formally get up ⏰ , I pick out your outfit (so naturally you look🔥)</p>

              <img width="100%" src="img/Day4/red.jpg">

              <p>​and we make some breakfast oatmeal 🍳 then head out to Dynamic Earth 🌏 </p> 
              <p>Turns out Dynamic Earth has a target 🎯 age range of about 9, but we still manage to have some fun and watch a weird show</p>

              <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day4/glasses.jpg">
              <img width="50%" src="img/Day4/glasses2.jpg">

              <p>​Next we head to the Grassmarket Area and Pumpkin Brown 🎃 for lunch where we get some interesting vegan salad situations which are definitely not enough food</p>

              <!-- <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day4/food.jpg">
              <img width="50%" src="img/Day4/food2.jpg"> -->

              <p>​Afterwards we hit the famous Mama’s Milk Bar for some interesting ice cream 🍨 paired with a delicious dark hot chocolate ☕️</p>
              <p>​We move on to go a lil grocery shopping for mojito materials! 🍋🍃🍹 and then head back to the room for a shower 🚿 and some fun ☺️ before dinner</p>
              <p>​After a strenuous decision making process we settle on Tangs for a classic tasty dinner of 🍣 and noodles 🍝</p>
              <p>​Post dinner we head to the Christmas Markets!! 🎄 to peruse and get waffles! While I really wanna go on rides 🎢 your mom told you no so we don’t go on any</p>

              <img width="25%" style="float: left" src="img/Day4/market.jpg">

              <img width="25%" src="img/Day4/market4.jpg">

              <p>​Finally, we are crazy exhausted 😴 😩 after all the catching up the 1st night so we head back to your room to go to sleep p early san mojitos (a good idea)</p>

              <p><b>​Sunday 12/3</b></p>

              <p>​After a spectacular nights sleep I am given the best wake up of all time 😍 and then we start the day</p>
              <p>First, we head to Urban Angel 😇 for breakfast and after a 30 minute wait that we use to walk 🚶️ around and checkout another Christmas market 🎄</p>

              <img width="50%" src="img/Day4/church.jpg">

              <p>​We are eventually seated and you get your oatmeal and I get arguably one of the best avotoasts (maybe even breakfasts) I’ve ever had</p>
              <p>​Next on the agenda is the real purpose for the visit, work! 📚 💻</p>
              <p>We make moves to U Edinburgh where we stake out a table at the Edinburgh Periodicals and get to work 📓 ✏️</p>

              <img width="100%" src="img/Day4/periodical.jpg">

              <p>​I block all social media 🙅 and distraction sites from your life to help you concentrate on your essays</p>
              <p>​After an albeit short but productive sesh we head back to Christmas market central to go Ice Skating ⛸ stopping by the Christmas markets 🎄 again along the way to get a quick yummy snack</p>

              <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day4/sunset.jpg">
              <img width="50%" src="img/Day4/shoes.jpg">

              <p>​With big plans we move on to Hula where I try a new sandwich 🥪(not as good as the chicken 🐔siracha wrap) and get my yummy breakfast for the next day (it was really good) although some hats 🎩 are tried on along the way at, you guessed it, the Christmas markets 🎄</p>

              <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day4/monkey.jpg">
              <img width="50%" src="img/Day4/russia.jpg">

              <p>​We stop for a quick but tasty Bubble Tea 🍵</p>

              <p>​before skipping the Nelson Monument and going to get groceries for a spaghetti 🍝 with meatballs dinner</p>
              <p>While shopping we also make another exciting purchase:</p>

              <p>​Light up Christmas sweaters!!!!! So lit 🎄💡</p>
              <p>​We tried to watch a movie (Holiday I think?) while we ate the amazing dinner we (read: mostly you) made, but the movie didn’t work out too well 😉 and eventually tiredness forced another quick nap 😴</p>

              <p><b>​12/4</b></p>
              <p>​A sad morning when I have to leave at 4:30AM 🕟</p>
              <p>​Made even sadder 😢 by how great our weekend was and the uncertainty of the next visit</p>
              <p>It’s been an amazing term abroad, thanks 💕</p>

              <p>Today is the first full day of advent I'm not with you which is making me really sad. Today, however, is not all about sadness. While I meant to do this on the 4th, you'll just have to go with it.</p>

              <p>Today marks the day of one of our favorite dates. If you remember on July 4th, we hiked Mt. Cardigan for dinner, some amazing views, and fireworks!! I think it was our first date after talking and you saying you wanted to do more date like stuff and I was really proud of planning something like that.</p>

              <p> Anyway, amidst all this essay writing, studying, and test taking, I hope this can take you back to a better day, date, and time, when the views were good and the company was better.</p>

              <p>First of all, while I know we haven't been physically together for the whole time, happy 4 months. Now to the fun.</p>
              <p>It may be a classic, but a movie date is a classic for a reason, and we've see quite a few.</p>
              <p>We've netflixed and chilled, chilled and watched netflix, gone to outdoor drive in movies, gone to indoor stay in movies, seen good ones, and objectively the worst movie of all time. We've watched tv in the US, Edinburgh, Budapest, and Stockholm.</p>
              <p>It only seems right to feature some favorites and other movie memories we've shared.</p>
              <p>First of all, let's just get this nonsense out of the way.</p>

              <p class="modal-text">Finally, posting on the correct day! A happy 10th day of Advent to you!</p>
              <p>I know we haven't really talked in a while, but I just wanted to let you know what I've been up to.</p>
              <p>I've been having a really nice time with my parents in Bratislava so I thought I'd show you some of the stuff we've been doing, especially because a lot of it makes me think of you.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We got here and first headed to the airbnb, which I think you'd really like. It's quaint and not quite as nice as our Stockholm palace but still really cute. The theme is blue (your second favorite color).</p>
              <p>Next we headed into old town where we walked around a really nice Christmas market for a bit. You obviously came to mind. At this point Christmas markets are pretty synonymous with you.</p>
              <img width="100%" src="img/Day10/cm.jpg">
              <p>Next we had a delicious lunch at this place that I, again, think you would have loved. I had pumpkin ginger risotto and it was so good.</p>
              <p>We headed over to a central are to meet for the walking tour and we met in front of the most fancy hotel in Bratislava (AKA where you will stay when you are here, of course)</p>
              <img width="100%" src="img/Day10/carlton.jpg">
              <p>The walking tour was really interesting, Bratislava is such an interesting city.</p>
              <p>We saw Bratislava Castle, and St. Martin's Cathedral.</p>
              <img width="64%" style="float: left" src="img/Day10/cc.jpg">
              <img width="36%" src="img/Day10/cc2.jpg">
              <p>We learned about the sad Jewish history.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day10/jews.jpg">
              <p>We saw some funny statues (this guy is down there looking up ladies skirts).</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day10/peeper.jpg">
              <p>We saw some beautiful statues as  well, and soviet era structures.</p>
              <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day10/sb.jpg">
              <img width="50%" src="img/Day10/sb2.jpg">
              <p>And we caught a beautiful sunset.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day10/sunset.jpg">
              <p>We walked through one of the gates of the city. They have a funny compass you walk over where they have distances to different cities. All of them are correct, except they also have pointers to the North and South Pole that are the same distances alluding to Bratislava being the center of the world. I thought that was funny.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day10/gate.jpg">
              <p>We passed the famous blue church, unfortunately it was already pretty dark. But the thing looks like a giant marshmellow!</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day10/blue.jpg">
              <p>It wasn't quite dinner time yet but we were cold so we went to the cutest little cafe (which you absolutely would have loved), and I got mulled wine, my dad got tea, and my mom got a chai latte!</p>
              <p>Finally we went to dinner high up on the hill where the castle is. The place we went was so good!!!! It was in these caves and is the oldest restaurant in Bratislava. I got some tasty lamb. I thought you would have really liked it, it was very festive.</p>
              <br>
              <p>This is actually from back in Budapest the night they arrived, I just thought it was a cute picture so I'm sharing it.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day10/fam.jpg">
              <p>Hope the essays are going well and you have a good 10th day.</p>

              <p>While my day may not be particularly happy (my graphics project is not really working and is very due tomorrow morning), I always like to throw it back to better days.</p>
              <p>If you ask me, some of our best days were spent here in Budapest. Your visit here brought some of the best memories we've shared and it makes me really happy looking back on them. From the second I picked you up at Ferenc Liszt International Airport, to the moment you went back through security, everything was perfect.</p>
              <p>Do I remember getting way too wasted at Boat Party? Yes. Do I still feel like an ass about that? Absolutely.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/boat.jpg">
              <p>But let's focus on the good. Planning out that weekend meant so much. I really loved being able to show you around, especially after you'd planned such a nice weekend in Edinburgh.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/glasses.jpg">
              <p>Let's be honest, there aren't thatttt many good photos of us. But a lot of them came from this weekend. I know photos aren't your favorite but it made me so happy that we got those, I can't even put it into words.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/bright.jpg">
              <p>Yeah, my camera is good. But you are just about the most photogenic person I've ever met and you look so good in every one of these. I think this one might be my favorite... but it's so tough to decide:</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/perfect.jpg">
              <p>And while the kissing ones may not be your favorites... I think this one is adorable.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/kiss.jpg">
              <p>Ahhh you just look so stunning in all of these.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/views.jpg">
              <p>Another highlight of the trip for me was the baths. That was romantic af and so much fun. (Minty Bath > ) If we ever get the opportunity to do something like that again, it's a must. Also this pic is so awkward and cute.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/baths.jpg">
              <p>For me that trip just reminded me of so many of my favorite things about us, from our desire to explore, to our dope planning, to your classic selfies.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/selfie.jpg">
              <p>Oh, and also how you're a model.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day11/model.jpg">
              <p>Anyway, if it wasn't clear, I'm really missing you right now. Not knowing when I'll see you next is sad, and scary. But looking back on these trips makes things better. So here's to next time.</p>

              <p>While this is indeed an Advent Calendar, centered on a Christmas tradition, I thought I might talk about some of my traditions surrounding this season.</p>
              <p>So this is the first night of Hanukkah and it's kinda weird not being home. For me, while not as hype as Christmas for you, Hanukkah was always a fun holiday with some nice traditions. I thought maybe it'd be nice to tell you about some of them.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day12/menorah.jpg">
              <p>My family would always make sure to light the candles every night, and while we are neither observant nor religious, we'd still do the prayers and these are some of the only prayers I know because of it.</p>
              <p>Back in the good old days of being a little kid, I'd usually get like legos or pokemon cards or something small as gifts each night. Nowadays I usually only get gelt, and my grampa usually gives me a funny gift relating to money, as is custom.</p>
              <p>Last year, for example, he bought me a few shares of stock in Manchester United (a soccer team that happens to be a rival of the team of my team but it's the thought that counts).</p>
              <p>Another of my favorite traditions is our family holiday party. While we always celebrate Thanksgiving with my Dad's side, either us or someone on my Mom's side always throws a holiday/Hanukkah party.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day12/cousins.jpg">
              <p>Here's me and my sister with some of our cousins.</p>
              <br>
              <p>My family always makes a ton of latkes from scratch which is so fun and they are so tasty. And on Christmas Eve, we often get chinese food (as jews do), or go see Christmas For the Jews - a jewish standup comedy event that is absolutely hilarious.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day12/selfie.jpg">
              <p>Anyway, I know you're out there crushing your essays. But when you get a chance, I'd love to hear more about your Christmas traditions and that kinda thing because I know it means a lot to you.</p>

              <p>First off, today was the best day. Why, you ask? Good question. Well schools over, and that's lit and all. But getting that message that you wanted to facetime. And just chatting and catching up made my day and likely my week.</p>
              <p>Anyway, riding that high, I got home and decided that day 14 had to go up. I was looking through pictures and thinking of ideas for themes. But the only thing that was coming to mind was how happy I was looking back at some of these pictures. And boom, I realized I had gotten my theme. I just found pictures that you sent me that made me happy. (It wasn't hard).</p>
              <p>Some are adorable, some are funny, and some are just gorgeous. I hope looking back through them makes ya happy too.</p>
              <p>I'll start with 3 that are both funny and cute!</p>

              <p class="modal-text">Happy 15th day of Advent! I'm sorry I'm getting so behind, it's getting very hard traveling during the day and stuyding for my interview at night. So these next ones might be a bit quicker, not as good as the earlier ones. I apologize in advance.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I just finished a lovely trip in Vienna so I thought I'd share a little about what I did there.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day15/clouds.jpg">
              <p>We took an early train from Budapest and barely made it - we sprinted to the station from my house. Upon arrival, we left our luggage in lockers in central station so we wouldn't have to carry them around when we checked out of our Airbnb.</p>
              <p>Our Airbnb was very nice and quaint, unfortunately, the wifi was broken so that was interesting.</p>
              <p>We then headed to the city center to get lunch and catch a walking tour - my Dad's favorite activity.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day15/opera.jpg">
              <p>It was very cold but we made it through the pretty average but interesting tour. It was already dark so we ducked into St. Stephen's Church and then made our way to dinner at an adorable Viennese restaurant.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day15/dinner.jpg">
              <p>It was here that I had the embarrasing experience of ordering for my food in German. Embedding video is hard, but I'll share a lil transcript:</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day15/text.jpg">
              <p>Hope you enjoyed the video.</p>
              <p>Anyway, then we checked out the Haus Der Musik which was really interactive and fun. After this, we headed back to the house and we skyped and I went to bed.</p>
              <p>The next day we bought our train tickets to Prague, and then headed out to the ​Schonbrunn Palace!</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day15/palace.jpg">
              <p>The palace was amazing, but not quite as extravagent as Versailles.​ Next we make our way to Kuntshistorisches museum, which was what my mom wanted to do most.</p>
              <img width="70%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day15/sky.jpg">
              <p>Afterwards, we took a really nice tour of the Imperial Treasury which was pretty cool. They had a unicorn horn, the Holy Grail, and one of the largest emeralds in the world!</p>
              <p>We tried Mozartkugeln!</p>
              <p>Finally, we meandered slowly to the train station stopping at interesting stuff along the way before catching our train to Prague.</p>
              <p>Overall, I thought Vienna was a really grand and cool city. Reminded me a lot of New York and Paris which I did not expect. I thought you realllyyy woulda liked the Christmas Markets.</p>

              <p class="modal-text">​I’m gonna get on top of these, just you watch.</p>
              <p>​As you know, most of my posts thus far have been very photo heavy. Since, however, I’m currently cramped on a plane between an elderly woman and a man who easily requires 2 seats, I don’t think I’ll be able to get my computer. So I’m just gonna write, if that’s alright.</p>
              <p>​I felt bad, about the lack of pictures, but quickly realized that the day I want to take you back to doesn’t have any pictures. Maybe we were having too good of a time, probably we just forgot, either way, I’d like to take you back to your birthday.</p>
              <p>​You didn’t know it at the time, but a lot of planning went into that evening. I made the Der take me to the spot, I stole a table and chairs, and set them all up a couple days before. I had to check in with Alisha about your sushi preferences and get you your headphones and the decorations and candles.</p>
              <p>​It may not compare to planning a full week in Edinburgh for your mom, but I was pretty proud of myself.</p>
              <p>​Walking down those sketchy train tracks, your reaction when I ditched you for 5 minutes to finish setting up, your even better reaction at seeing the finished product, and even when I ate shit going back down the hill - all makeup one of my favorite memories from summer term.</p>
              <p>​Here’s to a lot more memories like it. Happy Day 16.</p>

              <p>Sooo I was thinking about two things that factored into day 17. 1, you're not using facebook and I wanted to make sure you don't forget about some of these gems. And 2, I boost your ego so much it'd probably be good if I find some more ridiculous photos of you. hehe</p>
              <p>Sooo, here is a collection of some of the gems I found on Facebook of ya.</p>
              <p>We'll start with some more recent funny ones.</p>

              <p>Today I thought I'd do a rewind to one of my favorite weekends of the entire term - our visit to Stockholm.</p>
              <p><b>Friday 11/17</b></p>
              <p>At 3pm pick up Juliana at the airport
              Take the ~Arlanda Express~ to the city center and then cab to the airbnb which is 
              You brought your Woolrich so you’re an Eskimo</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/1.jpg">
              <p>​After a tour from Adrian the model and making ourselves at home we head to Biblioteksgatan #Woolrich and then dinner at Tako which turns out to be crazy expensive but just about the best sushi ever!!! (And a fancy atmosphere as well) Even tho the cocktail was p bad....</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/2.jpg">
              <p>​Next we walk over to Fotografiska, an incredible photo journalism 📷 museum with a really powerful exhibit on some of the atrocities in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and Haiti
              There’s a photo booth....</p>
              <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/3.jpg">
              <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/4.jpg">
              <p>​ We get drinks at the roof for the view 
              Next we take a hike up the cliffs of Fjällgatan for some more ~views~ and some pics</p>
              <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/5.jpg">
              <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/6.jpg">
              <p>​We then walk around looking for a place to buy cocktail ingredients (which we never make because there are only state liquor stores!!!!) but we get grapes  peach candy, and mint chip ice cream so it’s all ok</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/7.jpg">
              <p>​Finally we head home and eat the weirdest grapes ever and watch some VD which you promptly fall asleep for (I notice a trend) until we stop watching and you get verryyy awake ;)
              We finally drift off </p>

              <p>​<b>Saturday 11/18</b></p>
              <p>​Wake up at 8!!!.... kind of ;)
                By 9 you give me the nicest wake up eveerrrrr and we get ready to head out
                We head to Chokladkoppen for breakfast for some honestly underwhelming cinnamon buns but some tasty pancakes
                Next we begin to explore Gamla Stan (old town) starting with the Nobel Museum, a really cool museum about Arthur Nobel and the nobel prizes
                As we leave it begins to rain in Stortorget, the main square, and I don’t have an umbrella</p>
                <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/8.jpg">
                <p>​We make a quick detour by the Royal Palace because it’s kinda pouring
                We wander through old town taking in the sights as it stops raining</p>
                <p>​Finally we get to Marten Trotzigs gränd the skinniest Street at only 90cm wide!!!</p>
                <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/9.jpg">
                <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/10.jpg">
                <p>​It was time to get to the boat bus destination but we are real hungry so we make a quick pass of Parliament and make a pit stop at Wayne’s Coffee for some tasty bagel sandwiches
                Finally we head to Stromgatan where the bus leaves from!</p>
                <p>We embark and begin the bus tour which is so fun, it’s also golden hour so all photos are fricken beautiful</p>
                <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/11.jpg">
                <img width="50%" src="img/Day18/12.jpg">
                <p>​After the 3 hour (jk 75 min) boat/bus tour we hop off an make moves to Kungstradgarden where we saw an ice skating rink!</p>
                <img width="80%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/13.jpg">
                <img width="80%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/14.jpg">
                <p>We grab skates (even though they are only hockey) and hit the ice.</p>
                <p>Turns out I’m pretty good and while you’re not bad either you pretty much take all circulation out of my hand for the first few laps.</p>
                <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/15.jpg">
                <p>​Ice skating is a ton of fun but our feet start killing us to we are forced to go get hot chocolate and mulled wine</p>
                <p>​Our dinner reservations are for 7 so we have some time and we decide to hit the Spritmuseum</p>
                <p>It’s not the best museum ever but there are some funky smells, a weird lil bus where we listened to drinking songs, and a bad trivia game</p>
                <p>We also saw a weird movie about what it’s like to be drunk and a room that depicts a hangover, neither were particularly accurate</p>
                <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/16.jpg">
                <p>​We headed out to make our way to dinner but on the way encounter MOOD Mall and since we are running early #wow we take a peek</p>
                <p>Turns out it is a beautiful mall, with tons of Christmas and holiday decorations and chic restaurants AKA your heaven, we decide we will return</p>
                <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/17.jpg">
                <p>​We press on to Nalen restaurant for dinner and we get Swedish Meatballs!!!!! They are so gooodddd and the bread is really good, you give the restaurant an 11/10</p>
                <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/18.jpg">
                <img width="50%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/19.jpg">
                <p>Next we make our way 1 building over for the Avantgardet concert!!!
                Our first warning sign is that we bring the average age down 10 years....
                We wait for 1.5 hours which feels like a full day before finally they take the stage
                They are crazy the guy is running around the stage dumping water on himself and stealing other peoples mics within seconds</p>
                <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/20.jpg">
                <p>We stay for a few songs then bounce lol
                After a long train ride home, I shower and we get ready for bed</p>
                <p>After another night of VD and fun we fall asleep </p>

                <p><b>Sunday 11/19</b></p>
                <p>Another early wake up and some sefies</p>
                <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/21.jpg">
                <p>First is Cafe Saturnus for some delicious omelettes and a better cinnamon bun
                Next we head to the Vasa Museum which is huge! Really cool ship museum about a failed ship lol</p>
                <img width="33.3333%" style="float: left" src="img/Day18/22.jpg">

                <p>Feeling tired and cold, we take a peek at Skansen and Ekoparken but don’t stay
                Instead we head back towards the center and walk down Strandvägen, a fancy street on the water
                We pass by the Teatern and give a hug to the warm statue</p>
                <p>Getting hungry we head back to MOOD Mall for a delicious lunch of zoodles at Icha Icha</p>
                <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/25.jpg">
                <p>After walking around the mall we head to the closed Östermalms Saluhall to take a look
                We decide to rest before dinner and head home</p>
                <p>You have a lil headache so I make some tasty cinnamon mint tea and grapes and walnut</p>
                <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day18/26.jpg">
                <p>Mid kiss my nose decides to be a drama queen and I get the worst nose bleed of all time all over your face sorrrrrryyyyyy (and all over the sheets, blankets and the whole house)</p>

                <p>After cleaning up from the murder we head to East for dinner, the food in Stockholm May be pricey but it’s so good</p>

              <p>As it gets colder and colder here, I thought I'd do another throwback to the warmer months. I thought I was able to highlight some really good memories from this summer. But there were definitely too many to fit so I thought I'd throw a few more in. Here goes:</p>
              <p>I'll start with a night that may have started in pain, but was still surprisingly fun. I'm going to be honest, I don't even remember what exactly you were making in the first place. All I remember is you grabbing a scalding pan and burning you hand to bits.</p>
              <p>While you were in a ton of pain, and I felt terrible, we still managed to make some fun of the situation.</p>
              <p>First of all, you were being ridiculous like usual.</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day19/waterFight.jpg">
              <p>(No shit, silly)</p>
              <p>And somehow, even though we were in bed, the night turned into a water fight.</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day19/waterBucket.jpg">
              <p>Thinking back on this night makes me think about how much fun we can have even in an inherently shitty situation.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Moving on, a little out of order timewise, to when I was helping you pack to leave. Again an inherently shitty situation that I remember being surprisingly fun, as all time with you tends to be.</p>

              <br>
              <p>And finally, I wanted to throw it back to one of our last dates. I planned a picnic dinner in the golf course gazebo and it was just as fun as it sounds, even though it did get a little buggy.</p>

              <p>In fact, that may have been the night the patagonia became yours. I wish we could be back there right now. But these hilarious pics that came from that night will have to do</p>

              <p>As one of the final days of this advent season, I thought I'd focus on one of the final memories of sophomore summer - formal. Now, I would say that not all memories from formal are good ones, but that's not true. Everything I remember was great and fun.</p>
              <p>I remember the pre game to the pre game for your formal, hanging out with Jack and Taylor. I remember the actual pre game, meeting Sierra more formally and learning that she could tase me. Andddddddddd fast forward to my formal.</p>
              <p>First of all, this is a funny picture - thought we'd start there.</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day21/face.jpg">
              <p>I had such a good time at formal with you. Even though we didn't drink, spending an evening getting up dressed up and hanging out is a great recipe for a good night.</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day21/lake.jpg">
              <p>From the pre game at SD, to the long ass photo shoot on the beach,</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day21/look.jpg">
              <p>to me forcing you to dance, to our romantic little boat ride,</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day21/boat.jpg">
              <p>formal was a blast and I'm so happy you were there with me.</p>
              <p>And as a added bonus, we got something we very rarely get - an amazing picture of us. I mean seriously, look at you. Wow.</p>
              <img width="60%" style="display: block;margin: auto;" src="img/Day21/insta.jpg">
